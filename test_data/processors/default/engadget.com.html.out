<p class="image-container" style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2015/02/04/apple-beats-service-rumors/"><img title="Apple&#39;s Beats-based music service is reportedly headed to Android" src="http://o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/167d109ae8dd2fc92e6a0189ed4b639e/200517171/beats.jpg"/></a></p><p>There have been a few hints that Apple wants to integrate Beats Music into its existing software, but there are now signs that the tie-in will go especially deep -- and that Android users won&#39;t be left behind. Sources for <em>9to5Mac</em> claim that Apple not only plans to weave Beats-based streaming into Apple TV, iOS and iTunes, but that it&#39;s writing its own Android app from scratch (sorry, no Windows Phone version). The move wouldn&#39;t be completely shocking given that Tim Cook said he was cool with Android apps when they made sense, but it&#39;d still represent an important milestone for a company that frequently tries to get <em>away</em> from Google.</p><p>As for what the service entails? Not surprisingly, it&#39;s reported to be a best-of-both offering. You could search for anything in the Beats <em>or</em> iTunes catalog, and you&#39;d still see Beats&#39; human-made playlists and social networking. You could flag those tracks you want to hear offline, too. Importantly, Beats wouldn&#39;t override Apple&#39;s existing services. You could still use the likes of iTunes Match syncing and iTunes Radio streaming, even when they&#39;re occasionally redundant.</p><p>How soon this Beats-backed technology would launch could be up in the air, though. The report backs rumors that Apple is trying to lower the price (possibly to $8 per month), which might depend on labels agreeing to different rates. Also, development is supposedly a &#34;mess.&#34; Apple may not be all that clear about its vision for the service, and veteran Apple staffers purportedly aren&#39;t happy to see Beats engineers taking on important positions. While the reworked service was meant to launch in March, the tipsters now think it&#39;s more likely to show up at the Worldwide Developers conference in June. However it shakes out, everything suggests that this Beats-based project is no small feat -- Apple wants to take on streaming heavyweights like Spotify, even if it means delays and support for rivals&#39; platforms.</p>
